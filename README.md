Project Desription:
This repo contains the application source files containing the 
implementation of all the requirements outlined in the assignment for 
week 1 of the 'Intro to Embedded Systems SW' course offered in 
coursera.org.

The application performs very basic statistical analytics on a dataset 
defined as an array of unsigned char items in the code. The statistics 
implemented are: maximum, minimum, mean, and median. The mean and median 
are rounded down to the nearest integer (no support for fractional data 
representation). The program also sorts the data from large to small. 
Statistics and sorted data are reported in the console during execution.
